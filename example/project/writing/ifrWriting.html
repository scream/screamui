I\'d like to ask you some legal advice. Last week, I was broken my right arm in the gym room when I was using the equipment. I think the equipment was faulty. That day, I heard some sound from the equipment when I was using it. After a few minutes, I was broken. I told the gym, they said that I did not use the machine correctly. Actually, I use the machine every day so I totally understand how to use it. Meanwhile, there had a witness told me that she saw a screw dropped it down from the machine when I was using it. She is willing to testify in the court.</div><script type="text/javascript" src="../../../script/app/writing/writingEdit.js"></script></body></html>
